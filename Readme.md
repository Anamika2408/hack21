# Hack21

## Project Description
In an emergency situation it is hard to find a bed in hospitals, especially, in the times of the pandemic, we saw how people struggled for ventilators.

A web portal which can be used both by the patients and the admin staff at the hospitals. The patients can view available beds in the nearby hospitals, register hospital beds/ ventilators on their way to the hospital in an emergency situation skipping the cumbersome paperwork, and get consultations from the doctors for minor ailments from their home itself.
